First time use:

Check out the Image directory to see what the ADALM2000 Active Learning Module looks like.

Check out this blog page to see an example of my set-up:
http://www.biophysicslab.com/2019/09/09/experimentation-with-analog-devices-adalm2000/

Launch the main program on a Windows, Linux, or OSX Mac machine with python version 3 (tested with versions 3.6 and 3.7). Take note of the missing libraries and add them to your environment as needed (all libraries are part of anaconda if you choose to use this environment).


For regular use of main program:

Run ADALM2000 Scopy Oscilloscope to export CSV files associated with your lab work. Alternatively use the MakeWaves.py program within the Tools subdirectory to generate data with a simulated ADALM2000 Scopy Oscilloscope export CSV file structure.

For each csv file to process, place your csv export files into one data subdirectory. The default is TestData. You can change this default in the common area of preferences.ini otherwise the directory can be changed during the main program run.


Some notes:

For each use of the main program you can generate a png image with the plot and a txt file with a lab report showing a history of data entry and key results.

Default entry options are stared with an asterisk "*" so the user can just press the <enter> most of the time to move from one feature decision to the next...


Sample dialog during execution of main program:
